# Solid Design Principles

An exploration of the SOLID design principles using the C++ programming language. 



## Why Be Concerned About Design?

Software is often very complex, but by utilizing Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) principles like SOLID we can:

- Deal with complexity by using abstraction and a "dive-and-conquer" approach.

- Manage changes to software without having to refactor existing functionality.

- Provide functional, simple, and efficient code.



## Symptoms of Bad Designs

Without utilzing OOAD principles like SOLID, your software can end up:

- **Rigid** - *Rigidity* is the tendency for software to be difficult to change, even in simple ways. 

- **Fragile** - *Fragility* is the tendency of the software to break in many places every time it is changed. This is also referred to as being brittle. 

- **Immobile** - *Immobility* is the inability to reuse software from other projects or from parts of the same project. 



## What is SOLID Design?

The SOLID design principles are five principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They were first introduced in 2000 by American software engineer Robert C. Martin, and it has become one of the most widespread set of design principles in the software engineering industry. The SOLID principles are:

- **S**ingle-responsibility principle

- **O**pen-closed principle

- **L**iskov substitution principle

- **I**nterface segregation principle

- **D**ependency inversion principle
